      <description>A couple of months ago I ran (with lots of help for content) an R for biologists workshop.
It was aimed at wet lab biologists and biochemists who hadn&amp;rsquo;t done much coding before. R is a fantastic language for doing statistical analysis, making beautiful graphics and visualising very complex datasets. I highly recommend it. A lot of people say the syntax is quirky (it is) but once you get the hang of it, you won&amp;rsquo;t regret.</description>
