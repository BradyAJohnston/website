      <description>Working around the crashes Some pixel art of the results.
Wanting to test out a nucleic-acid generator I created in Animation nodes, I spent a bit of time putting together a test scene (bacterial RNA polymerase synthesising some RNA from DNA template).
Having set up a scene, done the math and gotten things working I was ready to try out rendering the scene. Unfortunately there are a few problems with rendering using Animation Nodes, and after rendering 1-3 frames Blender would crash.</description>
