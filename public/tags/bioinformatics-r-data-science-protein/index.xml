      <description>Visualising Proteins Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of structural bioinformatics. To avoid having to export my results into PyMol of Chimerax, I wanted a better solution that could embed the results more easily into the report that I was writing.
What would be even better than just an image of the final result is a fully interactive 3D model of the protein I was analysing at the time. Packages to achieve a similar sort of impact were already available in the form of 3Dmol.</description>
