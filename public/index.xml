      <description>Distill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.
Learn more about using Distill for R Markdown at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.
I’m going to create some code. Some code will be displayed below.
library(biochemr) DNase %&amp;gt;% b_enzyme_rate(conc, density, Run) %&amp;gt;% b_plot(colour = Run) + ggplot2::guides(colour = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) + ggplot2::theme(aspect.ratio = 1) And then below here.
There is some more text, to test re-rendering.</description>

      <description>Some code goes here for (i in 1:10) print(&amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;) end   Protein Motor Goes Brrrr   What about if I embed it as a video?
 # That&amp;#39;s a real shame. print(&amp;quot;Sad!&amp;quot;) ## [1] &amp;quot;Sad!&amp;quot; Can I reference the plot 1 which is right below?
library(ggplot2) p &amp;lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt, colour = as.factor(cyl))) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + labs(title = &amp;quot;A Simple plot&amp;quot;, x = &amp;quot;Miles Per Gallon&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Number of Cylinders&amp;quot;) p  Figure 1: Wow, just look at that plot!</description>

      <description>Visualising Proteins Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of structural bioinformatics. To avoid having to export my results into PyMol of Chimerax, I wanted a better solution that could embed the results more easily into the report that I was writing.
What would be even better than just an image of the final result is a fully interactive 3D model of the protein I was analysing at the time. Packages to achieve a similar sort of impact were already available in the form of 3Dmol.</description>

      <description>Where Rubbish Ends Up For this week&amp;rsquo;s #tidytuesday, I visualise the vast dataset of rubbish collected on the beaches all over the world.
I will leave out the technical details (check the tweet / Rpubs post for code) of how I achieved this, but you can see the result in the tweet below.
The data shows the headquarters for each company identified, and the lines show where the trash ended up.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

      <title>R for Biologists</title>

      <description>A couple of months ago I ran (with lots of help for content) an R for biologists workshop.
It was aimed at wet lab biologists and biochemists who hadn&amp;rsquo;t done much coding before. R is a fantastic language for doing statistical analysis, making beautiful graphics and visualising very complex datasets. I highly recommend it. A lot of people say the syntax is quirky (it is) but once you get the hang of it, you won&amp;rsquo;t regret.</description>

      <description>Updated my render of COVID-19 with some dynamics, virion is now to scale, additional surface proteins and some really nice lipid models thanks to @JackScienceWalk . This took 12 hours to render on my computer so hopefully the compression is&amp;#39;t too harsh #b3d pic.twitter.com/8xn8pGE6Y3

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>We need ChimeraX Recently a popular hashtag in the structural biology community went around of #weneedchimeraX which to be clear, we definitely do.
Funding was not looking good for the team was that was behind the incredibly powerful and importantly free tool ChimeraX. This also marked the start of the ChimeraX team&amp;rsquo;s journey into science twitter. One of their early tweets showed off the ability to generate a very cool animation using the morph functionalities and some nice graphical rendering.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started my journey into the realm of youtube.
After promising people at multiple conferences that I might start doing some tutorials on how to get into the very exciting if very intimidating world of 3D modelling, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally made the plung.
Maybe one day in a far off land (likely while I procrastinate writing my thesis) I will also write up accompanying documentation for how to achieve various looks and techniques (and some standards for importing / exporting 3D models).</description>

      <description>As I was drifting off to sleep one night, the thought hit me:
 &amp;ldquo;People love face filters, people love GFP, what if we combined the two?&amp;rdquo;
My brain, late at night.
 The next morning I had a quick look around and wasn’t able to find any evidence of anyone doing anything before. There has been a bit of effort into making AR protein apps and experiences, but we have all of these 3D models from all of the structural information that biology gathers, but nobody has put it into an instagram filter yet?</description>

      <description>Working around the crashes Some pixel art of the results.
Wanting to test out a nucleic-acid generator I created in Animation nodes, I spent a bit of time putting together a test scene (bacterial RNA polymerase synthesising some RNA from DNA template).
Having set up a scene, done the math and gotten things working I was ready to try out rendering the scene. Unfortunately there are a few problems with rendering using Animation Nodes, and after rendering 1-3 frames Blender would crash.</description>
