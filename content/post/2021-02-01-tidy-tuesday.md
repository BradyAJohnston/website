# Where Rubbish Ends Up

For this week's [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), I visualise the vast dataset of rubbish collected on the beaches all over the world.

I will leave out the technical details (check the tweet / Rpubs post for code) of how I achieved this, but you can see the result in the tweet below.

The data shows the headquarters for each company identified, and the lines show where the trash ended up. The more dots that move along the line, the more junk found in those selected companies' locations.

You can play around with the final result [here](https://rpubs.com/bradyajohnston/tt-2021-01-26#Using-the-joined-data-for-the-final-plot) (scroll to the bottom).
